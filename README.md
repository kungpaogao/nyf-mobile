# Not Your Family - Mobile

## Background
This app was created as a part of Capital One's Software Engineering Summit Hackathon. The idea of the app is to simplify the process of splitting reccurring fees in a household.

## Implementation
There are multiple parts to the service. Our team created an API that does the calculations and allows us to quickly access user balances; a web dashboard that allows users to view details about transactions; and, this app (in this repo) that allows users to view their transactions on the go.

We chose Flutter as a way to learn more about it and to allow us to deploy to both iOS and Android from one codebase. This was important to us because we only had 24 hours to develop the app.
